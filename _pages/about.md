<b style="color: green">Multimodal AI Lab @ EWHA</b> focuses on developing robust and generalizable AI models that understand and generate information across multiple modalitiesâ€”vision, language, and audio. 
Our research spans multimodal generation, large audiovisual/vision-language models, video understanding, 3D perception, and cross-modal grounding. 
We build multimodal systems that learn with minimal supervision and perform reliably in diverse, real-world settings.
We aim to push the boundaries of multimodal learning and create AGI that is creative, effective, and efficient.


**Recruiting Undergraduate Interns/ Graduate Students**:
We are looking for undergraduate interns, and graduate students to collaborate with! 
If you are interested in doing cool multimodal learning research, please send your CV and GPA to <a href="mailto:lee.jiyoung@ewha.ac.kr"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a>.
