Multimodal AI Lab@EWHA focuses on developing robust and generalizable models that understand and generate information across multiple modalitiesâ€”vision, language, and audio. 
Our research spans multimodal generation, video understanding, text-to-audio/visual generation, 3D perception, and cross-modal grounding. 
We build multimodal systems that learn with minimal supervision and perform reliably in diverse, real-world settings.
By bridging modalities and viewpoints, we aim to push the boundaries of multimodal learning and create AI that is context-aware, compositional, and creative.
