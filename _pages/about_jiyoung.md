### About Me
I am an assistant professor of the <a href="https://ai.ewha.ac.kr/deptai/index.do">Department of AI</a> at Ewha Womans University. 
Before joining Ewha Womans University, I was a research scientist at <a href="https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic/ai-lab">NAVER AI Lab</a> from Dec. 2021 to Feb. 2025. 
I received PhD from Yonsei University, advised by <a href="https://diml.yonsei.ac.kr/professor/">Prof. Kwanghoon Sohn</a>. 
Previously, I interned at Adobe Research in 2021, working with <a href="https://www.justinsalamon.com/">Justin Salamon</a> and <a href="https://dingzeyu.li/">Dingzeyu Li</a>, and collaborated with Microsoft Research, working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m7Jr-b4AAAAJ&hl=en">Daniel McDuff</a> and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/yalesong/home/">Yale Song</a> in 2020.

I am broadly interested in multimodal learning & computer vision. 
Mostly, I am interested in audio-visual/vision-language models, generative modeling, video understanding, and 3D vision, but not limited to.
